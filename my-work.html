                alt="This image is a collage of multiple media. The background is a bookshelf in warm colors of brown, red, and orange. Images of vines are laid throughout the bookshelf. Monarch butterflies fly in a group on the top left of the collage. A quote from Henry David Thoreau is in the middle of the image, where it's pasted onto a sheet of paper and flowers are on the corners of the paper. On the bottom of the collage is a flower bush with the statue of Persephone behind the bushes. This statue is to the right of the bushes. On the other side is an image of Persephone and Hades embracing (more in the next collage of Persephone)."

                alt="This image is a collage of multiple medias. The subject is of Persephone and Hades hugging in affection, her holding him in a motherly fashion and him embracing her. The glitched bushes to the right of them. A half transparent purplish-red moon on the top right of the collage. Screenshots from the graphic novel for Fahreinheit 451 rest above the red background on the top left. Butterflies flying to the left of Hades and some lemons on the bottom left near his elbow. The last element of the photo are the white flowers around Hades wrist, which his hand is holding onto Persephone's waist."
